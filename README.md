This repository stores the work as part of the Data Science: Foundations using R specialization by Johns Hopkins University. Course URL: https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-science-foundations-r. Code in this repository is written by myself, Kristen Phan.

__Caveat__:

If you're currently taking the same course, please refrain yourself from checking out this solution as it will be against Coursera's Honor Code and wonâ€™t do you any good. Plus, once you're worked your heart out and was able to solve a particularly difficult problem, a sense of confidence you gained from such experience is priceless :)

__Assignment Description:__
<br/>
Dataset description: 
File folder "specdata" contains 332 comma-separated-value (CSV) files containing pollution monitoring data for fine particulate matter (PM) air pollution at 332 locations in the United States. Each file contains data from a single monitor and the ID number for each monitor is contained in the file name. For example, data for monitor 200 is contained in the file "200.csv". Each file contains three variables:
<br/>
<br/>
Date: the date of the observation in YYYY-MM-DD format (year-month-day)
sulfate: the level of sulfate PM in the air on that date (measured in micrograms per cubic meter)
nitrate: the level of nitrate PM in the air on that date (measured in micrograms per cubic meter)
<br/>
<br/>
In each file you'll notice that there are many days where either sulfate or nitrate (or both) are missing (coded as NA). This is common with air pollution monitoring data in the United States.
<br/>
<br/>
Write a function that takes a directory of data files and a threshold for complete cases and calculates the correlation between sulfate and nitrate for monitor locations where the number of completely observed cases (on all variables) is greater than the threshold. The function should return a vector of correlations for the monitors that meet the threshold requirement. If no monitors meet the threshold requirement, then the function should return a numeric vector of length 0.
